      <h2>Rich Men North of Richmond – Oliver Anthony</h2>
      <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/78Du4CMFgnhdlG33gblkiP?utm_source=generator" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
      <p>
        Rich Men North of Richmond is a song where Oliver Anthony talks about how corrupt Corporate America is, hence "North of Richmond" referring to DC, the capital of the nation.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Oliver Anthony specifically says, "It's a [profanity] shame what the world's gotten to. For people like me, and people like you" And I feel like this is something Drew would say, because he constantly gets racist comments that he doesn't need. And even when he went to Andy's house, he started to get feelings that they're "different people" even though their friends. The just don't share physical traits.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Oliver Anthony also says "I've been selling my soul working all day. Overtime hours for [profanity] pay" And I feel like this is what's going through Drew's head, because while Politicians (people who aren't affected by racism in the book) barely do anything, and get everything handed to them, while Drew has to work much more, for barely anything.

      <h2>My Ordinary Life – The Living Tombstone</h2>
      <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6tMdpUXfT70TD6Eh3XfB1p?utm_source=generator" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
      <p>
        My Ordinary Life's lyrics can make you think that the songwriter is being opposed to a lot of people, which is exactly what's happening to Drew.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Opposition can be proved with the lines:
        
        <br><br>
        
        
        Line 1 - They tell me, "Keep it simple", I tell them, "Take it slow"<br>
        Line 3 - I tell them, "Take it easy", they laugh and tell me, "No"<br>
        Line 7 - They tell me, "Jesus walks", I tell them, "Money talks"<br>
        Line 9 - They tell me I've been sleeping, I say, "I'm wide awake"<br>
        Line 11 - They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank<br>
        Line 25 - They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head<br>
        Line 27 - They tell me I'm so humble, I say, "I'm turning red"<br>
        Line 31 - They tell me I'm a god, I'm lost in the facade
        
        <br><br>
        
        All these lines include someone telling them they're something, whereas they aren't. This is exactly what goes on with Drew, everyone believes all the racist stereotypes that are mainly directed towards Drew. However, in the song, there are lyrics where this someone admits that they are a lower level than the songwriter. Which is exactly what happens to Drew at the end, they come to a mutual understanding.

      <h2>3 O'Clock Things – AJR</h2>
      <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1gHvJW02LvPeywVfS6Els8?utm_source=generator" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
      <p>
        AJR's 3 O'Clock Things has many lines talking about hatred and freindship, which is what happens a lot in Class Act, drew constantly goes in and out from friends to enemies.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Specifically, the lines "It's kinda funny how I keep debating. If someone's shy or if they hate me". Refers to how disagreements can happen when people judge positively or negatively, which is exactly what's happening to Drew throughout the entire story.

      <h2>Adrenaline – MASN</h2>
      <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1XtKDLAUMpkP7d5As2tMdo?utm_source=generator" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
      <p>
        Adrenaline by MASN perfectly covers the emotions Drew has when he's speechless. For example, the line "Don't wanna die young. But I want to get close, that's why" Can relate to when Drew doesn't want to be the one in the center of all this stereotypical activity, but Is somewhat in a way, asking for it at the same time, by being aggressive, trying to make people stop, but that's only causing it to happen again.

      <h2>Sunday Best – Surfaces</h2>
      <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1qYKWcEOrh2tM8PlgIm8K1?utm_source=generator" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
      <p>
        The lyrics of Sunday Best by Surfaces solidly captures Drew's mindset in Class Act. The following lines are examples:
        
        <br><br>
        
        E-e-everyone falls down sometimes<br>
        But you just gotta know it'll all be fine<br>
        It's okay, uh-huh, uh, uh<br>
        It's okay, it's okay
        
        <br><br>
        
        The song directly says that people have highs and lows, but in the end, everything will turn out fine. Which is what happened to Drew during the entire book, he had a huge low, but it ended off with an "It's okay, uh-huh, uh, uh"

      <h2>Eyes Blue Like The Atlantic, Pt. 2 – Sista Prod (feat. Powfu, Rxseboy, Alec Benjamin)</h2>
      <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1eCTQhsNA31FcwyNcJcf86?utm_source=generator" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
      <p>
        Eyes Blue Like The Atlantic, Part 2 is a story of it's own. Each person who helped make the song had a few verses, with a few lines that perfectly match up with Drew's mindset. For example:

        <br><br>

        Rxseboy:
        
        <br><br>
        
        Or maybe run away because I'm sick of all the problems<br>
        Going down and I can't even see the bottom
        
        <br><br>
        
        These lines follow up with Drew's mindset because Drew has had second thoughts about the school ever since he got there, because of all the racial stereotypes faced towards him. And the 2nd line also follows up with Drew because when he didn't support Jordan when he got stereotyped, he got himself into a pit where he couldn't see the bottom until the assembly (metaphorically, not literally).

        <br><br>

        Powfu:
        
        <br><br>
        
        I love this show, but I won't see the second season<br>
        It won't be the same with my favorite person leaving
        
        <br><br>
        
        These lines follow up with Drew because the term 'second season' would refer to school next year. As drew wouldn't want to go because of his negative relationship with Andy. However the second line claims that next year wouldn't be the same without Andy, which also matches the book because Drew talked to Andy about how different it would be.

        <br><br>

        Alec Benjamin:
        
        <br><br>
        
        
        A rose will rise, and from the skies the sun will break the clouds<br>
        A rose will rise and blue skies will surround
        
        <br><br>
        
        In this verse, Alec talks about how there are moments that may feel tough, and you may also feel like there's no way out of it. But with time, things will get much better. This relates to Drew because his relationship with andy was negative for some time, until they talked about it and it got better.
